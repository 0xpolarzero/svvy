# Progress

Incremental roadmap from the current baseline to the shipped PRD.

How to use this file:

- Keep items small enough to land in a focused PR.
- Treat this file as a roadmap and progress tracker, not a changelog.
- Prefer adding new items next to the closest related step instead of appending unrelated backlog at the bottom.
- Keep sections ordered by dependency: durable facts and execution before projection surfaces that depend on them.
- When an item is done, change `[ ]` to `[x]` and append the landing commit hash or hashes.
- Write the capability that should exist or now exists, not migration wording like "replace", "remove", or "rename" unless that action is itself the remaining work.
- If the design changes, rewrite affected items to the new steady-state plan instead of leaving stale unchecked items from the old plan.
- If an item starts reading like a subsystem instead of a step, split it before implementation.
- For any big lift or unclear design, add a POC step immediately before the production implementation step.
- Use POC steps to validate shape, constraints, and UX without prematurely locking the final architecture.

- [x] Load the orchestrator and handler-thread instructions through pi's true `systemPrompt` channel before sending each real user message. Commit(s): `8a41d08`

- [x] Guarantee that a workflow-run failure or cancellation moves the handler thread into troubleshooting before any later user-directed closure or handoff. Commit(s): `a02bd48`
- [x] Derive workflow-run execution status, wait kind, heartbeat, finished timestamp, and summary from Smithers durable run state for runtime policy, handler tools, and workspace read models, while keeping `workflow_run` as the svvy ownership, cursor, attention, and product-link binding row.

- [x] Derive Project CI run/check read models through idempotent reconciliation over durable Smithers result facts and durable `svvy` workflow ownership facts, with terminal events, monitor reconnect, and app restart recovery all triggering the same derivation instead of relying on process-local terminal output memory or copied svvy output fields. Commit(s): a82abd62bc
- [x] Record missing durable Smithers terminal result output for a declared Project CI entry as a durable svvy projection failure or troubleshooting state instead of silently skipping CI projection. Commit(s): a82abd62bc

- [ ] Route all workspace-scoped backend requests and renderer sync events through explicit `workspaceId` instead of process-global cwd, active workspace, focused tab, or active runtime; keep app-global settings on separate app-global APIs, and require explicit `workspaceId` for workspace-affecting settings plus Context and Workflows library operations.

## 10. Pane Layout, Surface Ownership, And Expanded Surfaces

Current product decisions for this section are specified in `docs/specs/pane-layout.spec.md`.

- [x] Generate handler-thread titles with the same `namer` session agent used for top-level sessions, using the orchestrator-supplied `thread.start` objective as the naming input, while keeping workflow-run labels derived from the workflow's own name or entry metadata instead of adding a separate workflow-run title. Commit(s): `4d74c78`

- [x] Serialize inline mentions into the outgoing user message as normal workspace path links.
- [x] Render sent mentions in the transcript as actionable workspace links that reveal files, open folders, and visibly mark missing paths.
- [x] Keep mentions agent-neutral: no prompt injection, no eager file reads, no folder expansion, and no special context-target resolution.

## 13A. Queued Surface Messages

Current product decisions for this section are specified in `docs/specs/queued-messages.spec.md`.

- [ ] Persist queued user messages as structured surface-local product state keyed by `workspaceSessionId`, `surfacePiSessionId`, optional `threadId`, and FIFO queue position.
- [ ] When a composer submits to an active orchestrator or handler-thread surface, queue the message for that same surface instead of steering the current turn, interrupting tool work, starting a concurrent turn, or retargeting to the focused panel.
- [ ] Deliver queued messages as the next real pi user message after the owning surface prompt lock releases, creating a normal turn record and preserving prompt history as a single queue-time submission.
- [ ] Project queued messages near the owning surface composer, including count, order, remove, restore-to-composer, delivery failure, and duplicated-panel consistency.
- [ ] Restore queued messages after app restart without transcript inference and resume delivery only after the owning surface runtime and prompt lock state are reconstructed.

- [x] Render actor aggregate recipes for orchestrator, handler, and workflow task-agent prompts, linking instruction and context-pack rows back to their editable blocks and showing generated rows as scrollable code previews with editor links to generated context files. Commit(s): `118fd39c9f`
- [ ] Store user-named Context Library snapshots plus durable surface bindings with resolved prompt hashes and runtime standards hashes so historical sessions, handler threads, and workflow task-agent attempts remain inspectable after app restart.
- [ ] Add stale-prompt diff and action controls for existing orchestrator and handler-thread surfaces, including grouped semantic diff, raw text diff, update-for-next-turn, and keep-current actions.

- [x] Rename the sidebar label from `Saved Workflows` to `Workflows` while preserving the existing saved workflow and artifact workflow library behavior. Commit(s): pending

## 19. App Logs Surface

Current product decisions for this section are specified in `docs/specs/app-logs.spec.md`.
