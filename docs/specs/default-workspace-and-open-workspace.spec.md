# Default Workspace And Open Workspace Spec

## Status

- Date: 2026-05-18
- Status: adopted direction for startup, default workspace tabs, and workspace-opening commands
- Scope:
  - define the svvy-owned default workspace runtime
  - define the `Open Workspace` surface shown inside that default workspace
  - define current-tab and new-tab workspace opening behavior
  - define native app menu actions and shortcuts for workspace tab operations
  - define how default workspace tabs interact with workspace runtimes, Dockview layouts, Context, Logs, Workflows, sessions, and restore state

## Purpose

`svvy` should never boot into an empty page that only says `Open Workspace`.

When there is no restored user workspace tab, the app opens a real svvy-owned default workspace. That default workspace is a normal workspace runtime with sessions, Context, Logs, command palette, app logs, prompt history, provider settings, and other runtime-backed product surfaces available. Its initial focused surface is an `Open Workspace` panel that lets the user choose a repository. The default workspace does not have durable layout slots; default workspace tab layouts are ephemeral chrome state and are recreated as a single `Open Workspace` pane for each new default tab.

This keeps the app usable before a user chooses a repository while preserving the product rule that substantive repository work happens inside workspace runtimes.

## Source Boundaries

This spec supersedes older wording in `docs/prd.md` and `docs/progress.md` that says a startup with no restored tabs shows a standalone workspace picker.

The adopted model is:

- startup with no restored tabs opens a default workspace tab
- the default workspace tab shows an `Open Workspace` surface by default
- the open-workspace button opens a user workspace in the current visual tab
- `New Tab` creates another default workspace tab
- `Open Workspace in New Tab` creates a new tab for a selected user workspace

This spec does not change the core product architecture around pi-backed surfaces, handler threads, Smithers workflows, or explicit workspace routing.

## Definitions

### Default Workspace

The default workspace is a svvy-owned workspace root created and managed by the app.

It is a real workspace runtime. It is not:

- an empty disabled shell
- a fake workspace
- a process-global cwd fallback
- a hidden staging area for user repositories
- a replacement for user-selected repository workspaces

It exists so app-global and workspace-runtime-backed behavior remains available before a user chooses a repository.

### User Workspace

A user workspace is a local repository or folder selected by the user through an open-workspace picker.

User workspaces keep the existing product meaning:

- local repository context
- workspace cwd
- branch or VCS state
- path index
- sessions
- handler threads
- workflow runs
- app logs
- workspace read models
- pi-discovered runtime standards

### Workspace Tab

A workspace tab is a visual view over a workspace runtime.

Every workspace tab must have a stable chrome tab id. The tab id is separate from `workspaceId`.

Use:

- `workspaceId` for the shared backend workspace runtime
- `workspaceTabId` or equivalent for chrome tab state

Duplicate tabs for the same cwd share one backend runtime. Their durable user workspace layouts are also shared by `(workspaceId, layoutId)`; the tab only chooses which layout id is active.

Tabs do not own durable layout documents. A tab stores chrome state such as tab order, selected `workspaceId`, and active layout id. For user workspaces, durable layout snapshots are keyed by `(workspaceId, layoutId)` where `layoutId` is `A`, `B`, or `C`.

### Open Workspace Surface

The `Open Workspace` surface is a normal workbench panel that appears in the default workspace.

It is not a modal and not a standalone page.

It is a first-class panel target in the workspace layout so it can be focused, replaced, restored, and closed according to workspace shell rules.

## Product Model

### Startup

On app startup:

1. Load persisted workspace tab state.
2. Restore every persisted tab that still resolves.
3. If at least one tab restores, focus the persisted active tab when possible.
4. If no tab restores, create one default workspace tab.
5. Ensure the default workspace runtime exists.
6. Focus the default workspace tab.
7. Initialize it with exactly one `Open Workspace` pane.

The app must not show a separate centered picker-only page during normal startup.

Startup failure still uses the existing runtime error surface when the app cannot create any usable runtime.

### Default Workspace Location

The default workspace root must live under app-managed support data.

Adopted default:

```text
<svvy app data dir>/default-workspace
```

The svvy app data dir is the app-owned durable state root. Keeping the default workspace there makes it packaged-app safe and avoids writing into arbitrary user repositories while keeping PI-specific session storage under its own `pi/` child directory.

The exact path should be created by a Bun helper rather than hardcoded in renderer code, for example:

```ts
getDefaultWorkspaceCwd(appDataDir): string
```

Rules:

- create the directory on demand
- do not require it to be a git repository
- do not run repository discovery upward from it
- do not infer product runtime architecture from the source checkout
- do not place it under repo-root `workflows/`
- do not place it under a user-selected workspace

The default workspace should have a stable canonical cwd across app restarts.

### Default Workspace Identity

The default workspace must have a stable runtime identity derived from its canonical cwd, using the same runtime-id normalization as other workspaces unless a stronger explicit default id is needed.

The runtime must expose metadata that lets the renderer distinguish it from a user workspace:

```ts
type WorkspaceKind = "default" | "user";

type WorkspaceInfoResponse = {
  workspaceId: string;
  cwd: string;
  workspaceLabel: string;
  branch?: string;
  kind: WorkspaceKind;
};
```

The default workspace label should be `Default Workspace`.

`Open Workspace` names the panel and action that choose a user repository. It should not replace the workspace tab or sidebar footer label, because that makes the workspace identity look like a command.

### Default Workspace Runtime Capabilities

The default workspace supports:

- creating New orchestrator sessions
- prompt fallback from the command palette
- Context pane
- Agents pane
- Logs pane
- Settings
- provider auth and web provider settings
- agent profiles
- command palette
- quick-open placeholder
- app logs
- Dockview panels
- transcript rendering
- artifacts created inside the default workspace runtime

The default workspace does not support:

- repository-specific branch switching unless the default workspace is intentionally initialized as a git repository, which is not the adopted direction
- meaningful Project CI execution by default
- workspace workflow assets under a user repository
- treating default workspace files as user source files
- assuming Smithers saved entries exist

Workflows may be visible in the default workspace, but it should normally show an empty workspace workflow library unless the default workspace contains real `.svvy/workflows/...` assets. The UI must not fabricate workflow entries for the default workspace.

Project CI actions should be disabled in the default workspace with a reason such as `Open a repository workspace before running Project CI.` unless a future product decision explicitly gives the default workspace its own CI behavior.

### Open Workspace Surface Behavior

The default workspace's initial active panel is `Open Workspace`.

The panel should look like a normal svvy workbench surface:

- Dockview tab title: `Open Workspace`
- panel content uses the existing graphite workbench design language
- primary action: `Open Workspace`
- secondary action when useful: `Open Workspace in New Tab`
- optional recent workspace list from durable workspace tab history
- no marketing copy
- no centered full-app empty state outside the shell

The primary `Open Workspace` button opens the system folder picker and loads the selected user workspace in the current tab.

Current-tab open behavior:

1. User activates `Open Workspace` from the default workspace panel, native menu, or command palette.
2. App opens the folder picker.
3. If the user cancels, keep the default workspace tab unchanged.
4. If the user selects a cwd, open or acquire the backend user workspace runtime for that cwd.
5. Replace the current visual tab's `workspaceId` with the selected user workspace runtime id.
6. Preserve the current visual tab id and tab order.
7. Reinitialize that visual tab from the selected user workspace's active layout id and durable layout slot.
8. Focus the selected user workspace tab.
9. Persist tab state.

Replacing a default workspace tab with a user workspace must not delete default workspace sessions or logs. It only removes that visual tab's attachment to the default workspace runtime. The default runtime can be released if no tabs or background work still reference it.

If the current tab is already a user workspace, `Open Workspace` still opens the selected workspace in the current tab. This is a tab retarget operation, not a new tab operation.

When a current-tab retarget happens from one user workspace to another:

- preserve the visual tab id and tab order
- close the old visual tab attachment
- release the old workspace runtime if no other tab or background work references it
- initialize the new user workspace view from the tab's active layout id and the selected workspace's durable layout slot when available, otherwise use the selected workspace's default layout
- do not mutate or delete the old workspace's durable sessions, app logs, workflows, or Context state

### New Tab Behavior

`New Tab` creates a new visual workspace tab using the default workspace runtime.

The new tab:

- appears after the currently active tab
- becomes active immediately
- has a unique `workspaceTabId`
- uses the default workspace `workspaceId`
- starts with exactly one `Open Workspace` pane focused
- has no durable layout slots
- shares the default workspace runtime, sessions, app logs, Context, and prompt history with other default workspace tabs

Multiple default workspace tabs are allowed. They are separate visual views over the same default workspace runtime. Pane changes made inside a default workspace tab are allowed but ephemeral; they do not persist as layout slots and do not affect later default workspace tabs.

### Open Workspace In New Tab Behavior

`Open Workspace in New Tab` opens the picker and creates a new visual tab for the selected user workspace.

Behavior:

1. User invokes the action.
2. App opens the folder picker.
3. If the user cancels, no tab is created.
4. If the user selects a cwd, open or acquire the backend user workspace runtime for that cwd.
5. Create a new visual tab after the active tab.
6. Bind the tab to the selected workspace runtime.
7. Make the new tab active.
8. Initialize its layout from the selected user workspace's active durable layout slot when available, otherwise the selected workspace's default layout.
9. Persist tab state.

Opening an already-open repository in a new tab creates a duplicate visual tab for the same backend runtime. It must not focus the existing tab unless the user explicitly chooses a switch action.

### Tab Close Behavior

Closing a default workspace tab follows normal workspace-tab close behavior.

If closing the last remaining tab:

- immediately create a new default workspace tab
- focus its `Open Workspace` panel
- persist the new tab state

The app should not enter a zero-tab visible state during ordinary user interaction.

If shutdown happens with no user tabs, the persisted state may either record the default tab or record an empty user-tab set. On next launch, startup still creates a default workspace tab.

## Native App Menu

The app menu must expose workspace-opening actions as first-class menu items.

Add or update menu groups so the expected top-level product actions are discoverable:

- `File > Open Workspace...`
- `File > New Tab`
- `File > Open Workspace in New Tab...`
- existing session actions such as `New orchestrator`

Menu item labels should match command palette labels.

Menu clicks should send typed app-menu action ids through the existing app-menu message path. Do not create separate renderer-only event channels for these actions.

The shortcut registry is the source of truth for:

- action ids
- labels
- renderer hotkeys
- native menu accelerators
- compact shortcut labels
- readable shortcut labels
- input policy
- command palette linkage

### Shortcut Actions

Add these shortcut action ids:

```ts
type ShortcutActionId =
  | "workspace.open"
  | "workspace.newTab"
  | "workspace.openInNewTab"
  | ...
```

Include these in `AppMenuAction`.

### Keybindings

Adopted keybindings:

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open Workspace | `Cmd+O` | `Ctrl+O` | Standard open action, retargets current tab |
| New Tab | `Cmd+T` | `Ctrl+T` | Standard tab creation action |
| Open Workspace in New Tab | `Cmd+Shift+O` | `Ctrl+Shift+O` | Related to open, explicitly creates a new tab |

Existing keybindings remain:

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New orchestrator in Focused Pane | `Cmd+N` | `Ctrl+N` |
| New orchestrator in New Pane | `Cmd+Shift+N` | `Ctrl+Shift+N` |
| Quick Open | `Cmd+P` | `Ctrl+P` |
| Command Palette | `Cmd+Shift+P` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` |
| Toggle Sidebar | `Cmd+B` | `Ctrl+B` |
| Logs | `Cmd+Shift+1` | `Ctrl+Shift+1` |
| Agents | `Cmd+Shift+2` | `Ctrl+Shift+2` |
| Context | `Cmd+Shift+3` | `Ctrl+Shift+3` |
| Workflows | `Cmd+Shift+4` | `Ctrl+Shift+4` |

The open-workspace shortcuts are shell actions and should fire while text inputs are focused, matching command palette and session creation behavior.

### Command Palette Actions

The command palette must include:

- `Open Workspace`
- `New Tab`
- `Open Workspace in New Tab`

Availability:

- always available when the app has a main window
- available inside default workspace tabs
- available inside user workspace tabs
- available while a prompt is running, because opening a workspace tab should not interrupt a running surface in another tab

Execution targets:

```ts
type CommandExecutionTarget =
  | { kind: "open-workspace"; placement: "current-tab" }
  | { kind: "new-workspace-tab" }
  | { kind: "open-workspace"; placement: "new-tab" }
  | ...
```

The command palette fallback prompt behavior remains unchanged because the default workspace is a real workspace. Unmatched command-mode text creates a New orchestrator session in the active workspace, including the default workspace.

## Runtime And Storage Contracts

### Workspace Tab State

Workspace tab persistence needs separate runtime and visual identities.

Adopted shape:

```ts
type WorkspaceKind = "default" | "user";

type WorkspaceTabInfo = {
  workspaceTabId: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  cwd: string;
  workspaceLabel: string;
  kind: WorkspaceKind;
  openedAt: string;
  // User workspace tabs choose one durable slot. Default workspace tabs leave this unset.
  activeLayoutId?: WorkspaceLayoutSlotId;
};

type AppWorkspaceTabsState = {
  version: 4;
  activeWorkspaceTabId: string | null;
  tabs: WorkspaceTabInfo[];
  knownWorkspaces: WorkspaceTabInfo[];
};
```

Implementation must keep visual tab identity separate from runtime identity so duplicate same-cwd tabs and default workspace retargeting remain coherent.

Rules:

- `workspaceTabId` is unique per visual tab
- `workspaceId` points to a shared backend runtime
- duplicate same-cwd tabs have different `workspaceTabId` values and the same `workspaceId`
- retargeting a tab changes `workspaceId`, `cwd`, `workspaceLabel`, and `kind`, but keeps `workspaceTabId`
- tab reorder operates on `workspaceTabId`
- active tab state uses `activeWorkspaceTabId`
- runtime RPC routing still uses explicit `workspaceId`
- user workspace layout restore state uses `(workspaceId, layoutId)`
- each user workspace tab stores only its active `layoutId`; duplicate same-cwd tabs can select different active layout ids but share the same durable slot contents
- default workspace tabs do not use durable layout restore state

### Runtime Registry

The workspace runtime registry should support acquiring an existing runtime for a cwd instead of always throwing when the runtime is already open.

Needed operations:

```ts
openWorkspace(cwd, { workspaceId? })          // current create-only behavior
acquireWorkspace(cwd, { workspaceId? })       // create or return existing runtime
releaseWorkspace(workspaceId)                 // release visual owner, dispose only when unused
getDefaultWorkspace()                         // create or return default runtime
```

The implementation may keep `openWorkspace` create-only for tests and add a separate acquire operation for tab flows.

Duplicate visual tabs must not create duplicate backend runtimes for the same canonical cwd unless a future product decision explicitly introduces separate runtime profiles.

### Default Workspace Bootstrap

Bun startup should not rely on source-checkout cwd as the product workspace.

Startup should know:

- initial process cwd
- default workspace cwd
- whether to open initial user workspace from a launch argument or restore state
- whether no restored tabs requires a default workspace tab

`openInitialWorkspace` should be false unless a real user workspace was explicitly requested.

The default workspace should be created by product startup logic, not by treating process cwd as a workspace.

### Open Workspace RPCs

The existing `openWorkspace` RPC opens a picker when no cwd is provided. Its semantics should be split or made explicit.

Adopted request shape:

```ts
type OpenWorkspacePlacement = "current-tab" | "new-tab";

type OpenWorkspaceRequest = {
  cwd?: string;
  workspaceTabId?: string;
  placement?: OpenWorkspacePlacement;
};
```

Renderer responsibilities:

- call current-tab open from the `Open Workspace` panel button
- call new-tab open from `Open Workspace in New Tab`
- create default tabs through `New Tab` without invoking the folder picker

Bun responsibilities:

- resolve picker cwd when `cwd` is absent
- canonicalize cwd
- acquire workspace runtime
- return workspace info
- not decide visual tab placement

The renderer owns visual tab creation, replacement, ordering, and persistence because those are app chrome state.

## UI Requirements

### Default Workspace Tab

The default tab should read as a real workspace, not an error or command.

The tab label is `Default Workspace`.

The Dockview panel title inside that tab may be `Open Workspace` when the open-workspace surface is focused.

Status count badges behave normally. They summarize the default workspace runtime just like any other workspace runtime.

### Open Workspace Panel

Panel content should be compact and workbench-native.

Required content:

- title: `Open Workspace`
- short body: `Choose a local repository or folder to work in.`
- primary button: `Open Workspace`

Optional content:

- recent workspaces from `knownWorkspaces`
- secondary button: `Open in New Tab`

No full-screen marketing hero, no large decorative art, and no instruction-heavy onboarding copy.

### Sidebar

In the default workspace, sidebar actions are not globally greyed out.

Enabled:

- New orchestrator
- Search
- Command Palette
- Logs
- Agents
- Context
- Workflows, if it opens the default workspace's real workflow library
- Settings

Disabled or unavailable:

- branch switcher when the default workspace is not a git repository
- Project CI actions by default

Session sections show real default-workspace sessions. If no sessions exist, the sections show zero counts.

### Layout Controls

Durable layout slots `A`, `B`, and `C` are a user-workspace feature keyed by `(workspaceId, layoutId)`.

Default workspace tabs do not expose or persist durable layout slots. A new default workspace tab always starts with exactly one `Open Workspace` pane. If the user changes panes in a default workspace tab before opening a repository, those changes are ephemeral and are discarded when the tab is retargeted, closed, or recreated.

### Logs

Logs are enabled in the default workspace.

They show logs for the default workspace runtime. They do not become app-global logs.

When a user workspace is opened in the current tab, the tab switches to that workspace's logs stream because the visual tab now points at a different workspace runtime.

### Context

Context is enabled in the default workspace.

The Context Library remains app-owned settings with workspace-scoped activation rules, but current implementation may route reads through the active workspace runtime. This spec does not require moving Context to a separate global runtime before default-workspace launch because the default workspace provides a valid `workspaceId` for those operations.

Future work may still normalize Context storage to app-global state, but default-workspace launch removes the need for a disabled Context row in the startup state.

### Workflows

Workflows are enabled if the default workspace runtime can serve the normal saved-workflow library contract.

The default workspace should normally show no saved workflow assets unless assets exist under its `.svvy/workflows/...` tree.

No sample workflows should be fabricated just because the default workspace is open.

## Routing And State Rules

### Current Workspace

The active visual tab determines the current workspace for renderer commands that intentionally operate on the focused workspace.

Backend requests must still carry explicit `workspaceId`.

Menu and shortcut actions resolve as follows:

- `Open Workspace`: active visual tab, current-tab placement
- `Open Workspace in New Tab`: new visual tab
- `New Tab`: new default workspace visual tab
- `New orchestrator`: active tab's current workspace, including default workspace
- `Logs`: active tab's current workspace logs
- `Agents`: app-global agent profiles, evaluated from the active tab's workspace context when workspace-scoped projections are needed
- `Context`: active tab's current workspace-routed Context view
- `Workflows`: active tab's current workspace workflows

### Running Work

Opening, replacing, or closing a visual workspace tab must not interrupt running work in another tab.

If current-tab `Open Workspace` retargets a tab whose old workspace has running prompts, handler threads, or workflow runs:

- do not cancel them automatically
- keep the old backend runtime alive while running work or other tabs reference it
- surface running counts on any remaining tabs for that runtime
- if no visual tab remains but background work continues, retain runtime ownership until work reaches a safe terminal or waiting state

The exact background-runtime retention mechanism belongs to runtime registry implementation, but this spec requires that tab retargeting is not a destructive operation.

### Recent Workspaces

The app should keep a durable `knownWorkspaces` list for picker affordances and Context scope options.

Rules:

- include user workspaces selected through picker or explicit cwd
- exclude the default workspace from user recent-workspace lists unless a control explicitly asks to show all workspace roots
- preserve cwd and display label
- update recency when a user workspace is opened
- use canonical cwd as the deduplication key for known user workspaces

### Restore

Persisted restore state should not depend on a no-workspace state.

Restore rules:

- restore persisted user workspace tabs when possible
- restore persisted default workspace tabs as chrome tabs initialized with exactly one `Open Workspace` pane
- if no tabs restore, create one default workspace tab
- if the active tab id cannot be restored, focus the first restored tab
- if a user workspace cwd no longer exists or cannot open, replace that tab with a default workspace tab containing exactly one `Open Workspace` pane and an inline restore error
- do not block the whole app on one failed tab restore

## Error Handling

Picker cancellation:

- no mutation
- no error log
- keep focus in the invoking tab

Selected cwd cannot be opened:

- keep existing current tab binding
- show inline error in the `Open Workspace` panel if invoked there
- emit an app log error in the invoking workspace runtime when available, otherwise in the default workspace runtime

Default workspace cannot be created:

- show startup failure surface
- emit runtime log to stderr or bridge log if app logs are unavailable

Retarget fails after runtime acquisition:

- preserve previous tab binding when possible
- release the newly acquired runtime if no tab uses it
- log the failure

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `workspace.open`, `workspace.newTab`, and `workspace.openInNewTab` to the shortcut registry, app menu action union, native menu, and command palette.
2. Add a stable default workspace cwd helper under Bun workspace/runtime utilities.
3. Add workspace kind metadata to workspace info and tab info contracts.
4. Split visual tab identity from runtime identity by adding `workspaceTabId` and migrating app workspace tabs persistence to a new version.
5. Add runtime registry acquire/release semantics so duplicate same-cwd tabs share one backend runtime and current-tab retargeting can release old runtimes safely.
6. Change startup restore so no restored tabs creates a default workspace tab instead of rendering a standalone picker page.
7. Add an `open-workspace` pane target and panel host surface.
8. Initialize default workspace tabs with exactly one `Open Workspace` pane and no durable layout slot writes.
9. Implement current-tab open replacement from the `Open Workspace` panel and `workspace.open` action.
10. Implement `New Tab` as a new default workspace visual tab.
11. Implement `Open Workspace in New Tab` as picker plus new user workspace visual tab.
12. Update sidebar, command palette, and layout controls so default workspace capabilities are enabled rather than greyed out.
13. Update known-workspaces persistence and recent-workspace filtering to exclude default workspace from user recents.
14. Update tests across tab restore, runtime registry, shortcut registry, command palette, menu dispatch, and renderer startup.
15. Update `docs/prd.md`, `docs/features.ts`, and `docs/progress.md` when implementation lands.

## Testing Requirements

Unit tests:

- default workspace cwd helper returns a stable app-owned path
- startup with empty tab restore creates one default workspace tab
- closing the last tab creates a new default workspace tab
- `New Tab` creates a default workspace tab after the active tab
- current-tab open preserves `workspaceTabId` and changes `workspaceId`
- open in new tab creates a new `workspaceTabId`
- duplicate same-cwd tabs share one backend runtime
- retargeting a tab releases the previous runtime only when unused and idle
- known workspaces exclude default workspace from user recents
- shortcut registry exposes correct accelerators for workspace actions
- command palette exposes workspace actions with correct availability

Renderer tests:

- no restored user tabs renders normal app chrome with a default workspace tab
- default workspace sidebar actions are enabled
- default workspace logs and Context open normally
- open-workspace panel primary button uses current-tab placement
- `Open Workspace in New Tab` leaves the default tab in place and opens the selected workspace beside it
- default workspace tabs do not show durable layout slots and always start with one `Open Workspace` pane
- branch footer falls back to workspace label when default workspace is not a git repo

Integration tests:

- app menu `Open Workspace` retargets current tab
- app menu `New Tab` creates a default workspace tab
- app menu `Open Workspace in New Tab` creates a selected user workspace tab
- `Cmd+O`, `Cmd+T`, and `Cmd+Shift+O` dispatch through the shortcut registry and app menu path
- running work in one tab is not cancelled by opening another workspace in a different tab

E2E tests:

- first launch with no restored tabs shows normal svvy shell, not a standalone empty picker
- the first visible panel is `Open Workspace`
- chat can be started in the default workspace before choosing a repository
- choosing a repository from the first panel opens it in that same tab
- opening a repository in a new tab preserves the default tab
- duplicate same-cwd user tabs share sessions, app logs, and durable layout slots keyed by `(workspaceId, layoutId)` while each tab keeps only its active layout choice

Run e2e through the OrbStack machine lane with `bun run test:e2e`.

## Non-Goals

- Do not create a separate no-workspace shell state.
- Do not make Logs app-global.
- Do not fabricate workflow entries in the default workspace.
- Do not make Project CI meaningful in the default workspace by default.
- Do not route workspace RPCs through process cwd or active runtime instead of explicit `workspaceId`.
- Do not introduce a standalone terminal, alternate TUI, or shell loop.
- Do not store default workspace state under repo-root `workflows/` or any source-checkout-relative Smithers path.
- Do not focus an already-open user workspace tab when the user requested `Open Workspace in New Tab`.
